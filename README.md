# Snapnik
### A script that snaps and uploads screenshots to Teknik.io.

### Requirements
- You must use a third party app to bind the script to a keyboard shortcut. (FastScripts is the recommended one)
- You must have imagemagick installed.
- You must be running Mac.

### Notes
- For the time being you can not upload into an account (Teknik does not allow it).
- All images are downscaled for better web use, mainly because of the retina resolution being so big in both scale and filesize.
