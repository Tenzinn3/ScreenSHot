# ScreenSHot
- OSX Screenshot utility that uses macs inline screenshot app and the FTP protocol via cUrl.
- Screens are uploaded to an ftp and then the url is copied to your clipboard.
- Allows easy url sharing for example "http://i.example.com/8rd4hf.png"

This is written in bash and should work on all OSX versions that come with the OSX Screenshot app installed, this script makes use of the following.

- FastScripts (Available at http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/)
- cUrl

This is pretty easy to setup.

- Firstly download the master as a zip, and extract to wherever you want.
- Fill in the FTP section then chmod +x the file.
- Create a folder called "img" in Documents.
- Download and install fastscripts, it will allow you to bind the script to custom keys of your choice.
- Not much else to it.
