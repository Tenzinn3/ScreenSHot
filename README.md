# Snapnik
### A script that snaps and uploads screenshots to Teknik.io.

### Notes
- You must use a third party app to bind the script to a keyboard shortcut.
- You must have imagemagick installed.
- For the time being you can not upload into an account (Teknik does not allow it).
- You are able to select an area to take a screenshot of.
- A link will be copied to your clipboard after the screenshot has been uploaded.
